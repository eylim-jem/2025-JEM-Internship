    """
   Understanding power distribution and its key concepts is essential for maintaining stable and 
   safe electrical systems. Electricity flows from the power stations, then the current is sent through transformers that 
   increase voltage so power can e pushed over long distances. The charge is then carried by transmission lines to a substation 
   where the voltage is lowered so it can be sent on smaller power lines to your honme. The retailer then quantifies your usage before you are sent the bill.

    Distribution lines:
    - low voltage for homes and buisnesses

    Transformers:
     Transformers are used to either step up or step down the voltage of electricity, they also ensure safe transmission and distribution across the grid

     Feeders carry electricity form substations to various distribution points such as trasformers directly to consumers. Thus, feed electrical power to lower-voltage parts of the grid.
