    Understanding power distribution and its key concepts is essential for maintaining stable 
    and safe electrical systems. Electricity flows from power stations, where it is transformed 
    to high voltage for long-distance transmission. The current is then carried by transmission lines 
    to a substation where the voltage is lowered for distribution to homes and businesses. The retailer 
    then quantifies your usage before sending you the bill.

    **Distribution Lines:**

    Redundancy refers to incorporating backup systems, equipment, or infrastructure to ensure a continuous 
    and reliable electricity supply. In case one distribution network fails, there remain alternative paths to supply energy, 
    minimizing outages, maintaining grid stability, and ensuring that customers have a constant power supply.
    In the case of emergency or maintenance, following a "n-1" rule in network planning allows for planned or unexpected failures to have less impact on network stability.
